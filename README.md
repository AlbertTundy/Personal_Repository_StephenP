# Personal_Repository_StephenP

This one was a challenge from me. It is essentially the first website I've made from the ground up with no starter code. It is the outline for an about me website that just needs the details plugged in.

The goal was to make a fully responsive and styled website and I think that I've made excellent personal progress working towards that end. I will say that I could probably put in some more time and fix some of the styles but for now I'm proud of the results.
